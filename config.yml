# Please read README.txt for instructions how to configure your distributions.
# This distribution is a minimum configuration that distributes all except 100 LSK,
# and sends 1% of that amount as a donation to cc001 :)
# If you don't want to make that donation, just remove/change it and define your own distributions
# Please make sure that the spacing and intents are correct, they are important in .yml-files.

default:
    Sender:
        # Add here a host where you want to send the api commands to. I recommend to use your own node.
        # I strongly recommend to use only nodes that are pretected with SSL (https://....)
        # because your secret passphrase needs to be submitted to this node to be able to execute transactions.
        # Make sure to not put a '/' at the end of it
        # Example:
        # Host: "https://login.lisk.io"
        Host: "REPLACE_ME"
        
        # Add here the address of the account from where you want to send the transactions
        # Example:
        # Address: "12312352346456L"
        Address: "REPLACE_ME"
        
        # Add here the PublicKey of your account
        # Example:
        # PublicKey: "234234645jfweijf9384rz76gr39ehg938th283th398gh94ghb832gb9238gbwiegb83f"
        PublicKey: "REPLACE_ME"
        
        # Add here your secret passphrase of the account you want to send the transactions from
        # The passphrase is needed to be able to send transactions
        # If you leave it empty like this: Secret: "", the script will ask you on the prompt to enter it during runtime.
        # Of course this can not be used when run by cron
        # Secret: "word1 word2 word3 word4 word5 word6 word7 word8 word9 word10 word11 word12" 
        Secret: "REPLACE_ME"
        
        # Add here your second passphrase if you configured it.
        # If no second passphrase is configured, remove it completely.
        # If you leave it empty like this: SecondSecret: "", the script will ask you on the prompt to enter it during runtime.
        # Of course this can not be used when run by cron
        # Example:
        # mySecondSecret: "other1 other2 other3 other4 other5 other6 other7 other8 other9 other10 other11 other12" 
        SecondSecret: "REPLACE_ME"
